        <p>Camp Half-Blood is a sanctuary for demigods and nature spirits. The campgrounds are surrounded by a magical barrier that keeps monsters and mortals out. The camp began back in Ancient Greece with the first campers brought by Apollo for Chiron to teach and train. The magical borders were put in place after a large monster attack nearly wiped the Camp out of existence back in Ancient Greece, though luckily with the help of some former campers that were able to come to their aid in time the current campers were able to fend off the attack.</p>
        <img src="images/rsz_thalia-pinetree.jpg" alt="image of Thalia Grace's pine tree">
        <p>Roughly around the year 2000 a group of demigods were arriving at Camp with monsters on their tail and unfortunately one of them, Thalia Grace, Daughter of Zeus, gave her life protecting her companions. Her father then preserved her life force in the form of a large pine tree on the border of Camp. Her tree reinforced the strength of the magical barriers. Six years later, a group of campers went on a quest to retrieve the Golden Fleece after Thalia's tree was poisoned. They returned victorious and the Fleece not only healed the tree, but brought Thalia back to life. Our dragon Peleus has guarded the Fleece and borders since.</p>
        <p>As Camp Half-Blood grew it was moved from the base of Mount Pelion, Chiron's home, to the base of Mount Olympus as well as gaining a multitude of Satyr guides to lead young half-bloods safely to Camp. Since the first relocation, the Camp has moved with the gods as the core of Western Civilization traveled around the world. It is currently in America, with Camp Half-Blood located in Long Island, New York.</p>
        <h4>Meet Our Staff</h4>
        <img src="images/Dionysus.webp" alt="image of Dionysus, a man in a leopard print Hawaiian shirt with a beard and shoulder length hair">
        <p>Our esteemed Camp Director is Mr. D, or as you may know from the myths, Dionysus, the god of wine and theatre. He has been sent here for 50 years before we will be graced with a new director.</p>
        <img src="images/Chiron_viria.webp" alt="image of Chiron, a centaur with a tweed jacket sweater vest and collard shirt, a kind smile and chin length hair">
        <p>Chiron, yes, the Chiron from all the famous stories, is our Activities Director and is the one that all the campers look to for advice and direction. He has been granted his wish of staying around until he is no longer needed, and with how things are going, that may be for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <img src="images/argus.webp" alt="image of Argus, a man covered in a hundred eyes with blonde hair and sunglasses and a suit">
        <p>Argus is our head of security. He was created by Hera back in Ancient Greece with a hundred eyes all over his body, helping him keep an eye on the safety of our campers.</p>
        <p>Along with Argus, we employ three harpies to help with security so the campers can sleep safely in their cabins at night as well as clean up after each meal along with anyone on dish duty.</p>
        <img src="images/Peleus.webp" alt="image of a golden dragon curled around the base of a Thalia's pinetree with the Golden Fleece in the branches">
        <p>Peleus is also part of our security, protecting the borders of Camp as well as the Golden Fleece.</p>
